Gardiner.LoadedProjects
=======================

![Visual Studio Marketplace Downloads](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/d/DavidGardiner.LoadedProjects.svg)

Visual Studio extension for loading/unloading 'profiles' of projects.

You can save one or more 'profiles', which are a list of unloaded projects. This allows you to selectively unload or reload 
multiple projects at once. Very useful for dealing with large solutions to improve Visual Studio performance where
you don't need all projects open all the time.
